#### Project Target:
Simulate the spread of a virus such as SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen behind COVID-19.

Show the simulation progress in GUI. 

## Getting Started
1. run `MainJFrame` (locate at: `src/main/java/UserInterface/MainJFrame`) to get the GUI
2. Choose `Single Pathegon Simulation` or `Multiple Pathogens Simulation` to get into simulation mode
3. Select `Pathogen Type` and enter the `Population Density` textbox with number; check boxes to set some factors that attribute to the random area to begin spread the virus (if `Quarantine` is chosen as 'yes',
 the infection will not go outside that origin area) 
4. Click on `Start Simulation` and there will be a random-selected area as the beginning epidemic area, then
 canvas will show the progress of simulation
5. After the simulation stop, there are several charts to view using `See ALL Reports`, select the time of 
simulation to see details charts; Click on the `Show in Explorer` will open the picture in system
6. `Back` button take back from the report view page to simulation page

#### Design Document
- The `Project Design.pdf` is the design of GUI, UML of the project and program structure. 

#### Report Document
- The `Report for COVID-19 Simulation project Team 1.docx` contains project target, experiment conclusion of simulation with assumptions and support evidence.
- There are also charts and screen shots in `report` directory.
