#### Project Target:
Simulate the spread of a virus such as SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen behind COVID-19.

Show the simulation progress in GUI. 

## Getting Started
1. run `MainJFrame` to get the GUI
2. Choose `Single Pathegon Simulation` or `Multiple Pathogens Simulation` to get into simulation mode
3. Enter the `Population Density` textbox with number (better to larger than 5000);
 check boxes to set some factors that affect the spread of the virus (if `Quarantine` is 'yes',
 the infection will not go outside that origin area)
4. Click on `Start Simulation` and there will be a random-selected area as the beginning epidemic area, then
 canvas will show the progress of simulation
5. After the simulation stop, there are several charts to view using `See ALL Reports`, select the time of 
simulation to see details charts
6. `Back` button take back from the report view page to simulation page

#### Design Document
